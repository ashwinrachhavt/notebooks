      "Short answer\n",
      "- LangGraph is an open-source, Python-based orchestration framework (built by the LangChain team) for creating stateful, long-running, graph-based AI workflows and agents. It treats an agent/workflow as a graph of nodes and edges that pass and update a shared state, enabling complex control flow, loops, streaming, human-in-the-loop, durable execution, and production deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key ideas and features\n",
      "- StateGraph: workflows are explicit graphs where each node is a computation/step and the graph maintains a typed state object that flows between nodes.  \n",
      "- Nodes & edges: nodes run code or call LLMs/tools; edges (including conditional edges) route execution to the next node.  \n",
      "- Stateful & long-running: supports persistent state, checkpoints, and “time travel” / replay for debugging.  \n",
      "- Orchestration primitives: streaming intermediate outputs, parallelization, breakpoints, human-in-the-loop actions.  \n",
      "- Memory & stores: built-in patterns for short- and long-term memory and persistence.  \n",
      "- Deployment & tooling: CLI, local API server, observability and deployment integrations (LangGraph Studio / LangGraph API server / LangSmith tooling).  \n",
      "- Low-level control: intended as a lower-level orchestration/runtime than typical LangChain high-level agents — use it when you need explicit control over state, routing, retries, streaming, or multi-agent workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical use cases\n",
      "- Complex multi-step agents (research assistants, multi-tool pipelines)  \n",
      "- Multi-agent systems and sub-agent orchestration  \n",
      "- Workflows that require loops, conditional branching, and durable state across many steps or time  \n",
      "- Production agent deployments with observability, human handoffs, and streaming responses\n",
      "\n",
      "How it differs from LangChain agents\n",
      "- LangChain provides many higher-level primitives and \"chains\" for common LLM patterns. LangGraph focuses on the orchestration runtime: explicit graphs, durable execution, fine-grained control over state and routing. They integrate; LangGraph is often used as the underlying runtime for complex agent architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick start (conceptual)\n",
      "- Install: pip install langgraph  \n",
      "- Create a StateGraph, add nodes and edges, run inputs through the graph. Example (conceptual):\n",
      "  from typing import TypedDict\n",
      "  from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\n",
      "\n",
      "  class State(TypedDict):\n",

      "  workflow = StateGraph(State)\n",
      "\n",
      "  def classify_node(state):\n",

      "Where to learn more\n",
      "- Official docs and tutorials (LangChain / LangGraph docs and GitHub pages) — they include guided tutorials, examples, and a LangChain Academy intro course.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want, I can:\n",
      "- show a short runnable example using a real LLM/tool,\n",
      "- compare LangGraph vs a plain LangChain agent for your specific use case, or\n",
      "- walk you through building a simple stateful chatbot with LangGraph. Which would you like?\n"
